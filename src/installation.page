## Compatibility Notes

webgen should run on any platform which supports Ruby 1.9.3. It has been successfully tested on the
following platforms:

* Linux with Ruby 1.9.3 and 2.0.0
* Windows 7 with latest Ruby 1.9.3 from Ruby-Installer

See the platform specific installation notes for more information!

Furthermore, webgen should also run on jruby 1.7.0 and rubinius but that has not been extensively
tested.


## Platform Specific Installation Instructions

### Linux

There are a variety of Linux distributions out there with different package management systems. So
we will focus on instructions for Ubuntu 12.10 here (which should also work for any recent Debian
based distribution).

After running the following commands, webgen and all the mandatory dependencies are installed:

~~~ shell
$ sudo aptitude install ruby1.9.3 rubygems
$ gem1.9.3 install webgen --user-install
~~~

> Ubuntu has packages for the old 0.4.x and 0.5.x versions of webgen. If you want to use one of
> these versions (*not recommended*), you just need to run `sudo aptitude install webgen0.4` or
> `sudo aptitude install webgen0.5`.

### Windows

First you need to install Ruby 1.9.3 (or better). This can easily be done by using the Windows
[RubyInstaller] - just download the *latest* installation binary from their homepage and run it.
After that open a command shell (select `Start -> Run...`, then enter `cmd` and click on "Ok") and
type in the following:

~~~ shell
C:\> gem install webgen --user-install
~~~

[RubyInstaller]: http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/


### Mac OS X

Mac OS X Mountain Lion comes with Ruby and Rubygems preinstalled. However, the Ruby and Rubygems
versions are too old. You need to install a current version of Ruby 1.9.3 (or better) and then
Rubygems (there are many installation instructions for these steps, just search for them).

After that your system is ready for installing webgen:

~~~ shell
$ gem install webgen --user-install
~~~


## Generic Installation Instructions

### Using Rubygems

If you are using Rubygems, installing the latest version of webgen is as simple as executing

~~~ shell
$ gem install webgen
~~~

After this command has finished, everything is ready for creating websites. Be sure to have a look
at the optional dependencies which provide additional functionality.


### Manual Installation

The latest version of webgen can always be downloaded from [webgen's files section on
Rubyforge](http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=296). After the download the package needs to be
decompressed and then you can install webgen using the included `setup.rb` installation method:

~~~ shell
$ ruby setup.rb config
$ ruby setup.rb setup
$ ruby setup.rb install
~~~

Make sure that you also install the mandatory and, if you need them, the optional dependencies.


### Using the Repository Version

webgen uses git as its versioning system and webgen's repository is hosted primarily on Github. The
repository always contains a clean state of the current development version of webgen, i.e. webgen
should always work when checked out from the repository.

To check out webgen use the following command:

~~~ shell
$ git clone git://github.com/gettalong/webgen.git
~~~


## Dependencies

The following list shows all mandatory and optional dependencies for webgen. If you use Rubygems,
the mandatory dependencies are automatically installed. webgen can also make use of optional
dependencies if they are installed. Note that webgen was tested against the specified versions but
it should normally work with newer versions, too!

* (**mandatory**) [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org) version 1.9.3 or higher. Since webgen is written
  in Ruby, you need the Ruby interpreter to run webgen.
