# Welcome to the homepage of _webgen_!

webgen is a *free* (GPL-licensed) command line application for generating static websites. It
combines content with template files to generate HTML files. This allows one to separate the content
from the layout and reuse the layout for many content files.

Apart from this basic functionality, webgen offers many features that makes authoring websites
easier:

* Multiple markup languages to choose from for writing HTML and CSS files (**Markdown**,
  **Textile**, RDoc, **Haml**, **Sass**, ...)

* Automatic generation of menus, breadcrumb trails, ... and more!

* **Partial website re-generation** (only modified items get re-generated) which reduces website
  generation time enormously

* **Self-contained website** (all generated links are relative, so one can **view the website without a
  web server**)

* Easily extendable (all major components can be extended with new functionality or existing
  functionality can be replaced)

* No need to know the Ruby language for basic websites

The above list should just give you a glimpse of what is possible with webgen. Have a look at the
[features page](features.html) for a more complete list.
