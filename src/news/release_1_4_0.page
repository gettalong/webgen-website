Thanks to an (unrelated) bug report for a website with more than [4700 page files][discussion] I
tried to optimize the [node finder] a bit more, with quite good results!

Depending on the options one uses, node finder option sets can now be cached more effectively which
brings down the number of different node sets and therefore more performance (drastically in some
cases)!

Another important change is the new [io_open_mode meta information] which can be used to change how
a file should be opened. This allows one, for example, to use the mode 'r:BOM|UTF-8' to open UTF-8
files with a Unicode byte order marker without problems or to specify different encodings for
certain files.

Last but not least: webgen now uses [cmdparse] version 3.0.1 instead of 2.x which brings better help
output and some other nice changes. However, this also means that custom CLI extensions won't work
anymore! If you have written such an extension, please update it to be compatible to the newer
cmdparse version!

### Changes

* 7 minor changes:

  - Optimized [node finder] to more effectively cache node sets
  - Nicer hierarchical output for item tracker nodes descriptions when using `webgen show
    dependencies`
  - Updated [path handler api] to optionally produce a true hierarchical structure instead of the
    standard RDoc file/directory structure
  - Updated [path handler api] to additionally create fragment nodes for attributes (not just
    methods)
  - Updated [path handler api] template to use an `<h2>` heading instead of `<h1>`
  - The IO open mode can now be set on a per path basis with the new [io_open_mode meta information]
    (requested by Johann Friedrich Heinrichmeyer)
  - The [cmdparse] dependency has been updated to 3.0.1

* 6 bug fixes:

  - Fixed [content processor sass] to work with Sass 3.3 and greater
  - Paths named like `number.lang.ext` (e.g. `2014.en.page`) are now correctly handled (reported by
    Lars BÃ¤hren)
  - Removed invalid quote character from RSS feed template (patch by Sven Hertle, fixes [GH#6])
  - Paths like `someFile.png` now get the title 'SomeFile' instead of 'Somefile'
  - Fixed [path handler sitemap] to ignore nodes that have the [no_output meta information] set
  - Setting an empty pipeline on a block in a Webgen Page Format file now works
