I got mails about webgen not working with Ruby 1.8.6 on Windows anymore. It seems that a bug in the
1.8.6 release prevents webgen from correctly finding directories. However, this bug has already been
fixed which means that webgen should work again with the next One-Click-Installer for Windows. Until
then I recommend using webgen with the latest 1.8.5 version on Windows (I found that it is no
problem to have two versions of Ruby installed on Windows using the One-Click-Installer).

And now on to the new features and other changes:

* Updated exifr support to version 0.10 - versions lower than 0.10 are not supported anymore!
* redcloth is now a dependency sothat all the examples and website templates really work out-of-the-box!
* Removed website style `plain` due to incompatible license.
* Added submitted plugin Tag/HtmlMetaInfo from Andrea Censi - thanks!
* Added submitted plugin Tag/News from Jeremy Hinegardner - thanks!
* Added submitted plugin ContentConverter/Maruku from Andrea Censi - thanks!

Closed bugs:

* Page and template files can now be written using either Windows, Mac or Unix EOL encodings!
* Fixed order of webgen data directory discovery - local data directories are preferred now!
* File/TemplateHandler will not use the default metainfo from File/PageHandler anymore!
