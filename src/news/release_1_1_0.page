This release mainly re-introduces two options that were available in the 0.5.x series:
`website.link_to_current_page` and `tag.langbar.mapping` (formerly named `tag.langbar.lang_names`).


### Changes

* 2 Minor changes:

  - Re-implemented [tag.langbar.mapping configuration option]
  - Re-implemented [website.link_to_current_page configuration option]

* 2 Bug fixes:

  - Fixed problem with US-ASCII encoding on some internally used URIs
  - Fixed problem with "webgen install BUNDLE_NAME" where bundle could not be installed because it
    was missing and webgen ran into an error
