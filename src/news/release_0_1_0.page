webgen is a template based web page generator. It is used to generate static web pages from
templates and page description files.

All basic things are working and some documentation does also exist :-).

An example website is included which should get you started. Use "rake testsite" or change to the
testsite directory and type "ruby -I../lib ../bin/webgen" to build the testsite. The output will go
to testsite/output.
