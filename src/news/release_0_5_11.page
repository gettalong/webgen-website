In this release there are two big changes regarding the internals of webgen:

1. The dependency on facets has been removed since it was only used in two or three places and since
   the facets project is not very stable regarding its API.

2. The default markup language used by the webgen is Markdown and the default processor for
   converting Markdown to HTML has been Maruku for a long time. However, Maruku has some bugs that
   need to be fixed and although it runs under Ruby 1.9 there are some issues. Therefore the new
   default processor for Markdown will be kramdown from now on. Aside from being actively
   maintained, it is about 5x faster than Maruku and runs on Ruby 1.9 without problems.

   This means that if you used the default configuration, you will automatically use kramdown from
   now on. If you still want to use Maruku, just change the default processing pipeline for page
   files:

       default_processing_pipeline:
         Page: erb,tags,maruku,blocks,fragments

   The short name `markdown` now also refers to kramdown instead of Maruku.

Aside from the new content processor kramdown, another content processor for LESS has been added and
the content processor head has been updated to handle arbitrary `link` tags. Many bugs have been
fixed in this release as well.

*Note*: All deprecated methods have been removed in this release!

### Changes

* Major changes:

  - Added content processor kramdown (faster Markdown parser)
  - Added content processor less (extends CSS with variables, mixins, operations, ...)
  - Updated content processor head to allow the specification of arbitrary `link` tags and
    links to javascript and CSS files by the user

* Minor changes:

  - Added a CSS class to the HTML tag of the currently selected language of Tag::Langbar
    (requested by Damien Robert)

  - Fixed error in `SourceHandler::Virtual` when creating virtual directories (reported by Tuomo
    Valkonen)
  - Fixed bug in `ContentProcessor::Blocks`: `context.dest_node` was not correctly set when
    `#render_block` was called via the context object
  - Fixed bug in `Sourcehandler::Main`: an error was raised when the configuration option
    `output.do_deletion` was set to `true` (reported by Thomas Deselaers)
