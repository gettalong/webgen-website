Major changes:

* Now using cmdparse version 2.0.0!
* Attention: For unified naming in reference to image galleries, I have removed all occurences of
  the word "picture" from the code and documentation and replaced it with "image". Therefore you may
  need to adapt your code, especially custom gallery layouters!
* Attention: Many documentation and library files have been renamed for better consistency! Custom
  plugins may have to be adapted!
* New application for managing image galleries (only alpha quality currently!)
* Smileys are now optionally replaced with emoticons (several different emoticon packs available) ->
  see Misc/SmileyReplacer
* Site specific commands (used in command line processing) can now be used
* New plugin Tag/Download for nice download links
* New parameters: PageFileHandler:defaultPageMetaData, SitemapTag:honorInMenu
* Removed parameters: PageFileHandler:useERB, PageFileHandler:defaultContentFormat
* Renamed tag *navbar* to *breadcrumbTrail*
* Images in image galleries can now be ordered by specifying the `orderInfo` meta information
* The use of directory index files is now optional: by setting the parameter
  File/DirectoryHandler:indexFile to nil directory index files are not used
* Languages can now be specified using 2-char ISO-639-1 codes or 3-char ISO-639-2 codes
* Now there is a link (next to the wiki link) to the source of each page unless the page was
  programmatically generated.
