The new release contains some more documentation, bug fixes and many new features:

* directly noticeable is the colorized output for showing plugins and the configuration parameters
* more tags and new options for the existing tags
* support for 'virtual files' which allow the inclusion of links to external files into menus and
  the like
* better default handling of various error situations
* it's now easier to add new plugins for tags and file handlers
* and more ...

And last but not least, there is now a homepage at <http://webgen.rubyforge.org> which was generated
with webgen and shows most of its features.
