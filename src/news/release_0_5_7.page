Although this is a just a minor interim release, the 0.5.x series is declared stable with this
release and should be used instead of the old stable 0.4.x series! The one exception is when you
rely on features of the 0.4.x series that have not been ported to 0.5.x yet.

Aside from this this release brings some new features, various issues were fixed and the homepage
was updated so that the current version and release date are visible from the start page.

### Changes

* Major enhancements:

  - 0\.5.x series declared the new stable webgen series

* Minor enhancements:

  - Added two very useful options to ContentProcessor::Blocks
  - Added one new option to Tag::LangBar
  - Added `.ico` as extension that is handled by SourceHandler::Copy (suggested by Matthias Kirschner)
  - Added detection of non webgen website
  - Updated API and user documentation
  - Current webgen version and release date visible on start date (tip from Sebastian Gassner)
  - The webgen CLI now uses the environment variable `WEBGEN_WEBSITE` instead of the current
    directory as the location of the webgen website if the switch `-d` is not specified

* Bug fixes:

  - Fixed a small bug in Common::Sitemap: directories with just an index file did not appear in the
    sitemap (reported by Damien Robert)
  - Removed causes of Ruby code warnings
