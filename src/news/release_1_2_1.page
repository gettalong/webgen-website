This release brings mainly some overall and specific performance enhancements. The most benefit
comes from caching some often needed data and optimizing calls to `URI` objects.

However, there is also a specific benefit for those using kramdown and many predefined link
definitions as those will not get cached, too. Note that this will need at least kramdown 1.3.2 to
work!


### Changes

* 1 minor change:

  - Various performance fixes in [Webgen::Node], [Webgen::Path] and [Webgen::Context]

* 3 bug fixes:

  - [Content processor erubis] is now compatible to [content processor ERB] and therefore a drop-in
    replacement (which is much faster)
  - Fixed [node finder] 'descendants' filter to take already filtered nodes into account
  - Fixed display of path handler names in some error messages where class names were shown
