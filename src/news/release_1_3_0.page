This release fixes some bugs and introduces an updated node finder filter 'lang'. It now allows to
include nodes in the default language if such a node has no translation to the specified languages.
This means, for example, that if a website is not completely translated to some language, the
untranslated nodes appear in the menu.

### Changes

* 1 minor change:

  - [Node finder] filter 'lang' has been updated to support the default fallback language

* 3 bug fixes:

  - Fixed the [website.link_to_current_page] configuration option so that it really works (reported
    by Johann Friedrich Heinrichmeyer)
  - Virtual nodes now get the correct node class (reported by Johann Friedrich Heinrichmeyer)
  - Fixed [Webgen::PathHandler::Base::Node#url] to always return a string (reported by Johann
    Friedrich Heinrichmeyer)
