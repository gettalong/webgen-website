Another minor release which concentrates on fixing some bugs and adding some new features:

New features:

* Implemented support for sipttra (Simple Plain Text Tracker) files and using it for the project
  status page
* HTML is now the default content format for template files
* New parameters for Tag/BreadcrumbTrail: Tag/BreadcrumbTrail:omitLast and
  Tag/BreadcrumbTrail:omitIndexFile
* New parameter Core/Configuration:customVars for storing custom global variables and a new plugin
  Tag/CustomVar for accessing them
* Added an example websites section to the examples section
* Added a HowTo page which answer some often asked questions!
* Added a man page contributed by the Debian project

Closed bugs:

* Specifying arguments to the `run` command to render only certain files now actually works! ;-)
* Fixed bug when loading site specific plugins: the use of `load_plugin` should now work correctly!
* All website styles updated to behave correctly when File/DefaultHandler:linkToCurrentPage is false

Thanks for the many comments and suggestions since the last release, especially to Bill Paxton,
Massimiliano Filacchioni, Erhard Karger, Alejandro Sierra, Fritz Heinrichmeyer and Vincent Fourmond!
