This release contains some bug fixes:

* a small bug fix for Tag/News - there have been some cases where loading the plugin lead to an
  error. This has been fixed now!

* fixed a bug with file name resolution: filenames are now searched using a case insensitive search
  sothat, for example, images with an uppercase extension are processed correctly

* fixed bug in File/ThumbnailWriter: no check was performed if a thumbnail for a given image already
  existed

One new feature: links can now be customized by providing a custom link renderer via the meta
information `link_callback` - more information on the Meta Information Reference
