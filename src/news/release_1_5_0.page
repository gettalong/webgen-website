This is a small release bringing a new content processor for minifying CSS and a way to do cache
busting on any output file.

The cache busting works by incorporating the [modified_at meta information] into the file name. All
one needs to do to enable this feature is to set the [modified_at_in_dest_path meta information] to
`true`.

### Changes

* 2 minor enhancements:

  - Add [content_processor.cssminify] which minifies CSS
  - Add [modified_at_in_dest_path meta information] for incorporating the [modified_at meta
    information] into the destination path
