It has been long since the last version of the 0.5.x series, more than three years. If you thought
that development on webgen halted you were wrong.

With the two beta releases at the end of last year most of the major remaining bugs of this complete
rewrite were fixed and the only big job was to update the webgen website. This took me longer than
expected but during the update of the website, including all of the documentation, webgen was
actively used and in the process I uncovered some more problems which are now fixed, too.

So without further ado I present you **webgen 1.0.0**!

Why would you want to use it? Here are some reasons:

* The basic promise of webgen didn't change. It still allows one without knowledege of a programming
  language to easily create and generate a website, built from templates and content files. However,
  the one-oh-oh version now uses the latest libraries to do its job and is up-to-date in all
  regards.

* **Better CLI commands**: The webgen CLI now provides more tools for working with a website. Aside
  from the usual things like creating a new website and generating the output, it can show the
  available extension bundles, all available extensions, the configuration options (including
  documentation, syntax and examples), the generated node tree (including meta information) and node
  dependencies.

  With the addition of the **dry run mode**, you can preview what webgen would do without actually
  changing anything in the destination directory. Combine this with the [destination.show_changes
  configuration option] to see the actual changes that would be done!

* **Better partial site generation**: The whole core of webgen was ripped apart and re-implemented
  to make it easier to add dependent items to a node and the whole system got faster. It is now
  easier than ever to write an extension that handles a new type of item. Additionally, the webgen
  CLI can now show the items on which a node depends so that you can see at a glance why a node
  might get re-generated.

* **Node search API**: Many extensions need to generate a possibly nested list of nodes (for
  example, the [tag menu] or the [path handler feed]). Prior to webgen 1.0.0 each of these
  extensions had to do the work themselves. With this new version, the [node_finder extension]
  provides a mechanism to do this in a standardized way. You just provide it with a set of options
  that defines the nodes that you want and it does all the rest!

* **Many built-in extensions**: All built-in extensions that were available in 0.5.x are also
  available in the 1.0.0 version, plus some more. And if you are missing some extension, it is now
  *very easy to create new extensions*; you can even publish them as gems to make them easily
  available and installable to other users.

  Here are two of the new extensions:

  * The [misc.dummy_index] extension automatically generates directory index files that are missing.
  * The [path_handler.api] extension uses RDoc to create Ruby API documentation files that have the
    same look and feel as the rest of the website. No longer is it necessary to generate the API
    documentation separately!

  There are also some extension bundles available as Rubygems, they follow the naming scheme
  `webgen-...-bundle`.
