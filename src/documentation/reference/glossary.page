content processor

: An extension that processes content in any way (for example, convert markup to HTML or compress
  CSS).

  Also see: [content processor extension][content processors].

destination

: An extension that knows how to write data to some place (for example, to a certain [directory on
  the file system][destination file_system]).

  Also see: [destination extension][destinations].

meta information

: A key-value pair that provides information about a [source path][g:source path] or a
  [node][g:node].

node

: A node is created from a [source path][g:source path] by a [path handler][g:path handler] and
  represents a destination path that may be written to the [destination][g:destination].

  Nodes can have child nodes which creates a hierarchical structure called the [tree][g:tree].

  Also see: [Node API documentation][Webgen::Node].

passive node

: A [node][g:node] that is only written to its destination path if referenced by another node.

path

: See [source path][g:source path]

path handler

: An extension which creates [nodes][g:node] from [source paths][g:source path]. Each path handler
  knows how to interpret its source paths and how to write its nodes to the
  [destination][g:destination].

  Also see: [path handler extension][path handlers].

source

: An extension providing [source paths][g:source path] (for example, from a certain [directory on
  the file system][source file_system]).

  Also see: [source extension].

source path

: An object provided by a [source][g:source] that encodes an absolute path (i.e. starting with a
  slash), contains [meta information][g:meta information] and provides access to its content.

  Also see: [Path API documentation][Webgen::Path].

tree

: The data structure that contains all [nodes][g:node]. Each [webgen website][g:webgen website]
  contains exactly one tree.

  Also see: [Tree API documentation][Webgen::Tree].


webgen website

: Any directory webgen can correctly process as a website. A website directory is normally
  identified by having a webgen configuration file.
