## Description

This destination extension writes the nodes to a file system directory.

## Examples

The used destination extension can be specified via the [destination configuration option], so each
of the examples below can directly be used in the configuration file.

1. All nodes are written to the `out` directory under the website directory (the default
   configuration):

   ~~~ yaml
   destination: [file_system, out]
   ~~~

2. Writing the nodes to an absolute directory:

   ~~~ yaml
   destination: [file_system, /var/www/documentation]
   ~~~
