## Description

The meta tag is used to output the value of meta information keys. It is also used as fallback when
no tag extension for a specific tag name is found.


## Usage

This tag can be used in one of two ways:

* Since this tag is used as fallback, one can just use the meta information key as tag name.

  For example, if one defines a meta information key `revision`, one can use the tag `\{revision:}`
  to output the value of this meta information key.

* Alternatively, the tag can be used like any other tag via `\{meta_info:}` and the meta information
  key can be specified with the [tag.meta_info.mi] configuration option.

{:.warning}

There is one special case: The language for a node is initially set via the meta information key
'lang' but not retained in this form in the internal representation. However, it is often needed to
use its value and therefore one can also use `\{lang:}` for outputting a node's language.

An every day usage example for the meta tag would be including the title of a page in the
`<head>` section of a HTML template or specifying the language of the HTML file by using the
`\{lang:}` tag.


## Examples

`\{title: }`
: {title:}

`\{lang: }`
: {lang:}

`\{meta_info: {mi: config options}}`
: {::nomarkdown}{meta_info: {mi: config options}}{:/}
