## Description

This processor converts the content, which is assumed to be in Markdown markup, to HTML by using the
Maruku library. Maruku is a Markdown processor which supports a superset of Markdown, including
support for assigning ids and classes to every element, support for Markdown inside HTML elements
and footnotes.

> This extension is only available if the [maruku][1] library is installed. The preferred
> way to do this is via Rubygems:
>
>     gem install maruku
{:.library-needed}

## Usage

For detailed information about Maruku have a look at the [Maruku Homepage][1]. There you will find
information about the general Markdown syntax as well as information about the extras added by
Maruku.

> The Maruku library is not maintained anymore. It is recommended to use the
> [kramdown](kramdown.html) processor instead since it provides a nearly drop-in replacement and is
> actively supported.

## Example

Here is a short sample of a text in Markdown+Extras markup:

~~~
<%= context.node.blocks['example'].rstrip %>
~~~

When processed by this processor, the output would look like this:

~~~ html
<%= context.render_block('example').rstrip %>
~~~


--- name:example pipeline:maruku
# This a h1 header    {#myid}

You can just write *your* paragraphs here and
[link][1] them below. This is **nice** format!

> Citations are easy too.
> Really. And you can assign them attributes.
