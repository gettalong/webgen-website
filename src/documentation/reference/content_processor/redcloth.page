## Usage

This processor is intended to be used in the processing pipeline of page files. For detailed
information about Textile have a look at the [Textile Reference][1]!

Furthermore, the configuration option [content_processor.redcloth.hard_breaks] can be used to
enable/disable the conversion of single newlines into HTML break tags.


## Example

Here is a short sample of a text in Textile markup:

~~~
<%= context.node.blocks['example'].rstrip %>
~~~

When processed by this processor, the output would look like this:

~~~ html
<%= context.render_block('example').rstrip %>
~~~

--- name:example pipeline:redcloth
