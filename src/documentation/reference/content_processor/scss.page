## Description

This processor converts the content, which is assumed to be in the Sassy CSS language, to valid CSS
using the Sass library. This is basically a syntax based on CSS but additionally using features from
Sass.

> This extension is only available if you have installed the [sass][1] library. The preferred way to
> do this is via Rubygems:
>
> ~~~ shell
> $ gem install sass
> ~~~

## Usage

This processor should best be used in combination with the [path handler copy]. An easy way to do
this is by creating a file with the `scss` extension. This file is automatically handled by the copy
path handler which changes its extension to `css` and processes it with this processor.

For detailed information about Sass and the Sassy CSS language have a look at the [Sass
Homepage][1]!

If you don't like the syntax of the Sassy CSS language, you may also want to try the [Sass Meta
language](scss.html) which has an indentation based syntax and supports the same functionality as the
Sassy CSS language.


## Example

Here is a short sample of a text in the Sassy CSS language:

~~~
<%= context.node.blocks['example'].rstrip %>
~~~

When processed by this processor, the output would look like this:

~~~ css
<%= context.render_block('example').rstrip %>
~~~

--- name:example pipeline:scss
$width: 80%;

#main {
  width: $width + 10%;

  p {
    border-style: solid;
    border-color: #00f;

    a {
      font-weight: bold;
    }
    a:hover {
      text-decoration: underline;
    }
  }
}
