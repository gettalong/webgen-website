title: content_processor.rdiscount
---
## Description

This processor converts the content, which is assumed to be in Markdown markup, to HTML by using the
[RDiscount][1] library. This library is based on the C based discount library which provides very
fast Markdown processing. However, this processor does not support advanced features like the
[kramdown processor](kramdown.html) does.

> This extension is only available if the [rdiscount][1] library is installed. The preferred
> way to do this is via Rubygems:
>
>     gem install rdiscount

## Usage

This processor is intended to be used in the processing pipeline of page files.

Have a look at the [RDiscount homepage][1] for more information on the supported markup!


## Example

Here is a short sample of a text in Markdown markup:

~~~
<%= context.node.blocks['example'].rstrip %>
~~~

When processed by this processor, the output would look like this:

~~~ html
<%= context.render_block('example').rstrip %>
~~~

--- name:example pipeline:rdiscount
# This a h1 header

You can just write *your* paragraphs here and
[link][1] them below. This is **nice** format!

> Citations are easy too.
> Really. And you can assign them attributes.

* Lists
* aren't
* difficult
* either.
