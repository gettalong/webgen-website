## Description

This processor converts the content, which is assumed to be in the Sass meta language, to valid CSS
using the sass library.

> This extension is only available if you have installed the [sass][1] library. The preferred way to
> do this is via Rubygems:
>
>     gem install sass
{:.library-needed}

## Usage

This processor should best be used in combination with the [path handler copy]. An easy way to do
this is by creating a file with the `sass` extension. This file is automatically handled by the copy
path handler which changes its extension to `css` and processes it with this processor.

For detailed information about Sass have a look at the [Sass Homepage][1]!

If you don't like the syntax of the Sass meta language, you may also want to try the [Sassy CSS
language](scss.html) which has a syntax based on CSS and supports the same functionality as the Sass
meta language.


## Example

Here is a short sample of a text in the Sass meta language:

~~~
<%= context.node.blocks['example'].rstrip %>
~~~

When processed by this processor, the output would look like this:

~~~ css
<%= context.render_block('example').rstrip %>
~~~

--- name:example pipeline:sass
#main
  :width 90%
  p
    :border-style solid
    :border-color #00f
    a
      :font-weight bold
    a:hover
      :text-decoration underline
