## Description

This content processor uses the [`tidy`][1] program to process the content and convert it into valid
(X)HTML. It supports a vast amount of options for specifying how the input should be processed.


## Usage

This content processor should be used at the end of a processing pipeline of a template file after
the HTML document is completely generated. It takes the content and feeds it to the `tidy` program
which modifies it according to the set options.

The options for the `tidy` program can be set through the configuration option
[content_processor.tidy.options]. Note that the options `-q` and `-f FILE` are always set because
they are needed internally and should therefore not be set through [content_processor.tidy.options]!
