## Description

This path handler automatically **generates an atom or RSS feed** for a set of paths from a path in
[Webgen Page Format].


## Usage

The atom and RSS feed nodes are created by specifying special node version names. Only the node
version names 'rss' and 'atom' are allowed. So an RSS feed node is created if the 'rss' version name
is specified and an atom node is created if the 'atom' version name is specified.

By default, both atom and RSS nodes are created for a feed node because of the meta information in
the `/default.metainfo` path.


### Special Meta Information Keys for Feed Nodes

entries (mandatory)
: A [node finder] option set which specifies the paths that should be included in the feed.

  Note that the resulting node set is flattened even if the 'flatten' option is not used. It is also
  advisable to use the `sort: modified_at` option to ensure that the feed entries are correctly
  sorted!

site_url (mandatory)
: The base URL of the website for which the feed is generated. This is needed, for example, for
  generating the absolute URLs in the feed files.

author (mandatory)
: Specifies the feed author.

author_url (optional)
: Specifies the URL of the homepage of the author.

description (optional)
: A short description for the feed.

created_at (optional)
: The time at which this feed was created. Defaults to the current time if not set. Only used in RSS
  feed nodes.

content_block_name (optional)
: The name of the block that should be used for the content of the feed entries. If not specified
  the name 'content' is used. Be aware that each feed entry node needs to have such a block!


### Meta Information Keys of Entry Nodes Used in a Feed

created_at
: The time at which the entry was created. Only used as the publication time of the entry in atom
  feed nodes.

modified_at
: The time at which the entry was last modified. Used as the publication time of the entry in RSS
  feed nodes and as the update time of the entry in atom feed nodes.

title
: Used as title of the feed entry.

author
: The name of the author of the entry node. Only used in atom feed nodes!

author_url
: The URL of the homepage of the author of the entry node. Only used if the author information is
  also set and only used in atom feed nodes!


### Feed Templates

webgen ships a template `/templates/feed.template` for the generation of atom and RSS feeds. This
template contains two blocks:

* The **atom_template** block is used for the generation of atom feed nodes.
* The **rss_template** block is used for the generation of RSS feed nodes.

It is possible to customize the generated feed files by adding an **atom_template** block and/or and
**rss_template** block to the feed node itself or by customizing the `/templates/feed.template`
template.
