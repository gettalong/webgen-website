## Description

This path handler uses paths in [Webgen Page Format] which contain the **actual content for the
website**. Therefore this paths can also, optionally, contain meta information for the path.

Note that the extension `page` is automatically changed to `html` for the destination path and
canonical name.


## Usage

*In contrast* to other paths, page paths can never be unlocalized! If they have no language set, the
default language specified using the [website.lang] configuration option is used.
