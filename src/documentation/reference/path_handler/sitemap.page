## Description

This path handler automatically **generates a sitemap** based on the specification of
<http://sitemaps.org> from a path in [Webgen Page Format].

The extension `sitemap` is automatically changed to `xml` for the destination path and canonical
name.


## Usage

Sitemaps are used for informing search engines about pages on a site. Therefore a webgen website
should have at least one sitemap.

After a sitemap has been created and published, search engines need to be made aware of it. Have a
look at the [respective section][informing] on the Sitemap protocol page.

Also read the section about the possible [locations] of a Sitemap file because not all URLs are
allowed in all Sitemap files!

[locations]: http://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html#location


### Special Meta Information Keys for Sitemap Nodes

entries (mandatory)
: A [node finder] option set which specifies the paths that should be included in the sitemap.

  Note that the resulting node set is flattened even if the 'flatten' option is not used.

site_url (mandatory)
: The base URL of the website for which the sitemap is generated. This is needed so that the URLs in
  the sitemap can be created as absolute URLs.

default_change_freq (optional)
: The default change frequency of a path. This is used for paths that do not have the change_freq
  meta information set.

  This value is set to 'weekly' by default via the `/default.metainfo` path.

default_priority (optional)
: The default priority of a path. This is used for paths that do not have the priority meta
  information set.

  This value is set to '0.5' by default via the `/default.metainfo` path.


### Meta Information Keys of Entry Nodes Used in a Sitemap

[modified_at][modified_at meta information]
: Used for the last modification time of the sitemap entry.

  See the [&lt;lastmod&gt; tag definition][lastmod] for more information.

change_freq
: Used for the change frequency of the sitemap entry.

  See the [&lt;changefreq&gt; tag definition][changefreq] for more information.

priority
: The priority of the path in respect to the other path in the sitemap.

  See the [&lt;priority&gt; tag definition][priority] for more information.


### Sitemap Templates

webgen ships a template `/templates/sitemap.template` for the generation of the XML sitemap. This
template needs to contain a **sitemap** block which is used for rendering the sitemap.

It is possible to customize the generated sitemap files by adding a **sitemap** block to the sitemap
node itself or by customizing the `/templates/sitemap.template` template.

[lastmod]: http://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html#lastmoddef
[priority]: http://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html#prioritydef


## Example

Here is an example for the content of a sitemap path:

    ---
    site_url: http://site.example.com/
    entries:
      alcn: /**/*.html
    default_change_freq: daily
    default_priority: 0.2
    ---

Note that there is no content block but only a meta information block with the special meta
information keys that are needed.
