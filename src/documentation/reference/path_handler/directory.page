## Description

This path handler is used for directories, ie. it creates the destination directories.


## Usage

No special setup is required for this handler to work.


### Directory index path

However, it is possible to specify an **index path** for a directory which is used instead of the
plain directory index for displaying purposes. This means that whenever the path to a directory is
requested (e.g. when using the [tag reloctable]), it is replaced with the path to the directory
index.

The name of this index path is specified with the [proxy_path meta information] (which needs to be
set on the directory itself by using a meta info file, see [path handler meta_info]). The default
value that is set on all directories via the `/default.metainfo` path is `index.html`.

Since this default value is set on all directories, webgen shows a warning if it can not find the
directory index path for a directory. However, there are most certainly directories which should not
have or don't need an index path, for example, a directory containing images. To prevent webgen from
displaying warnings for such directories, you can set a null index path:

    dirWithOnlyImages:
      proxy_path: null

This will prevent webgen from showing warnings because you explicitly define a null index path.


### Localizing directory titles

The title for a directory can be set via the [title meta information] on the directory itself.
However, if the directory has an index path, the [routed_title meta information] of the index path
is used for the directory title. This enables webgen to provide correctly localized directory names.
