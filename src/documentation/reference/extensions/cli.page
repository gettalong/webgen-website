## Description

This extension provides a hook to add CLI commands to the webgen executable.

It is only available if the webgen CLI was used, not if webgen was used programmatically. And if it
is available, it is an instance of `CmdParse::CommandParser`. See the [Webgen::CLI] API
documentation for more information and an example.
