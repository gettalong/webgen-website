title: tag.relocatable
config options:
  - tag.relocatable.path
  - tag.relocatable.ignore_unknown_fragment

## Description

This tag ensures that the relative path to the specified path is always correct. This allows, for
example, the preview of the website without a web server.


## Usage

Note that this tag can only be used with paths (either (A)(L)CNs or destination paths) that are
known to webgen. A virtual node needs to be created for paths that are not normally handled by
webgen.

When this tag is used, it changes the directory part of the supplied path name to a relative path to
the destination. If the path is an absolute URL, i.e. one prefixed with "http://" or "ftp://" or
something like that, it is not changed.

If an URL fragment is specified, this fragment also has to exist in the node tree except if the
[tag.relocatable.ignore_unknown_fragment] configuration option is set. Another way to ignore an URL
fragment is to specify it directly after the tag!

A relocatable tag looks like this: `\{relocatable: default.css}`. If this was put into a template
and the template was used by a file in a sub-directory, then this tag would put `../default.css`
into the output file; thus ensuring that the relative path to file is valid.


## Examples

`\{relocatable: /css/design.css}`
: {relocatable: /css/design.css}

`\{relocatable: ../}`
: {relocatable: ../}

`\{r: /}`
: {r: /}
