title: Item Trackers
---

Item tracker extensions are used for tracking items of nodes so that webgen can do partial website
generation. Only those nodes where at least one item has changed are re-generated.

All built-in extensions use item trackers to ensure the correct re-generation of a website. If one
creates custom extensions or uses template engine for customization of a website, use of the correct
item trackers should be considered to ensure correct website re-generation.

Information about how to create an item tracker is found in the [Webgen::ItemTracker] API
documentation.
