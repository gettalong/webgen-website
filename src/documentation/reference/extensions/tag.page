## Description

These extensions allow the easy inclusion of dynamic content in, for example, page and template
paths. No knowledge of a programming language is needed to make effective use of tags and each tag
is used for a specific task like creating a menu or a breadcrumb trail.

Information about how to create a tag is found in the [Webgen::Tag] API documentation.

### Tag Templates

The output of some tags can be customized by providing a custom rendering template via a
configuration option.

This configuration option needs the (a)(l)cn of a template or page node as value and this node needs
to have a specially named block (normally of the form `tag.TAGNAME`). This block is then used for
rendering the output.

This mechanism allows you, for example, to add such a block to the default website template so that
there is no need to create a separate template.
