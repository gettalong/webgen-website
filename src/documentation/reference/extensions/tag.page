## Description

These extensions allow the easy inclusion of dynamic content in, for example, page and template
paths. No knowledge of a programming language is needed to make effective use of tags and each tag
is used for a specific task like creating a menu or a breadcrumb trail.

Information about how to create a tag is found in the [Webgen::Tag] API documentation.
