title: Extensions
---

webgen comes with many extensions that allow for the rapid creation of static websites. The variety
of the extensions allows you to use your tools of choice, for example, your preferred markup
language. And if your choice is not available, you can write the extension for it yourself or make a
feature request!

Extensions are only loaded when they are needed. For example, if you don't use `.feed` paths for
automatically generating atom/RSS feeds for your website, the path handler that handles these paths
will never be loaded. Therefore you don't need to explicitly enable most of the extensions, they
just sit in the background and wait until the webgen core needs them.
