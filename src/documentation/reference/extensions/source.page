Source extensions provide the paths (and their contents) that are then processed by the [path
handlers](#path-handlers). By default, all paths under the `src` directory are potentially used but
this can be changed with the [sources configuration option].

Information about how to create a source extension is found in the [Webgen::Source] API
documentation.
