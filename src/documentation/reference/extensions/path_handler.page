## Description

These extensions are used for handling source paths. They read the content of a path and produce one
or more nodes (the internal representation of a destination path, also see the [nodes
section](../../manual.html#nodes) in the manual for more information on nodes).

A path handler can do something simple like just copying a source path to the destination path but
they can also do complex things like creating a whole API documentation tree from just one source
path.

The path patterns (see the [path pattern documentation](../../manual.html#path-patterns) for more
information) which match the source paths that a path handler uses, are listed on the description
page of each source handler. Additionally, the meta information that is set on any node created by a
specific path handler is also documented.

Information about how to create a path handler is found in the [Webgen::PathHandler] API
documentation.
