title: misc.dummy_index

## Description

This extension provides the ability to create dummy index files in the case an index file (see the
[misc.dummy_index.directory_indexes configuration option]) does not exist but the directory itself
has a [proxy_path meta information] set.

Assume that we have the following source directory:

    /reference.page
    /reference/glossary.page
    /reference/other_things.page
    /reference.metainfo

And that `/reference.metainfo` contains the following:

    --- alcn
    /reference/:
      proxy_path: ../reference.html

Since the [proxy_path meta information] is set on the directory, gerneated links will automatically
point to `/reference.html`. However, when pushing this website to a webserver and navigating to the
`/reference/` directory, nothing useful is displayed because the `/reference/index.html` file is
missing. If this extension is enabled, such an index file will be created containing a redirect to
the correct location.
