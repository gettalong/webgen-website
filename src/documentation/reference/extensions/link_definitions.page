## Description

This extension provides a place to register link definitions that can be used by any other extension
to resolve links. A content processor that takes advantage of this possibility is the [content
processor kramdown].

One can define global link definitions in the following way (for example, in `ext/init.rb`):

~~~ ruby
# Just a URL
website.ext.link_definitions['link_name'] = ['link_url', nil]

# URL with title
website.ext.link_definitions['link_name'] = ['link_url', 'link_title']
~~~
