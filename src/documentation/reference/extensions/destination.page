title: Destinations

Destination extensions are used to write out the generated content. The default configuration for a
new website writes the generated content to the `out` directory of the website directory.

However, one could, for example, create a destination extension which directly writes to an FTP or
SSH server.

Information about how to create a destination extension is found in the [Webgen::Destination] API
documentation.
