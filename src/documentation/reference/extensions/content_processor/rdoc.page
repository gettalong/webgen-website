format for Ruby source files) to HTML.

[1]: http://docs.seattlerb.org/rdoc/ "RDoc Reference"


## Usage

This processor is intended to be used in the processing pipeline of page files.

Have a look at the [RDoc reference][1] for more information on the supported markup!


## Example

Here is a short sample of a text in RDoc markup:

~~~
<%= context.node.blocks['example'].rstrip %>
~~~

When processed by this processor, the output would look like this:

~~~ html
<%= context.render_block('example').rstrip %>
~~~

--- name:example pipeline:rdoc
= This a h1 header

You can just write *your* paragraphs here and link[http://someurl.example.com] them below.
This is also a _nice_ format!

* Lists
* aren't
* difficult
* either.
