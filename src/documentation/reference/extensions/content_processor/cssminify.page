title: content_processor.cssminify

## Description

This content processor compresses CSS files so that they take up less space which translates into
faster load time.

## Usage

Just add this content processor as the last processor in the pipeline for CSS nodes - that's it!

This can either be done via explicitly specifying the pipeline using a meta information node or by
adding the short name of this processor to the source path name (e.g. `/css/site.cssminify.css`).
