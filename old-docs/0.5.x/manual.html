        <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>This manual describes all of webgen in as much detail as possible. If you still find something
missing, don’t hesistate to write a mail to the mailing list!</p>

<p>The manual is structured in such a way that it can be read from top to bottom while creating a
webgen website. This means that first the information on how to use the webgen CLI comes, then how a
webgen website is structured and how content can be added and so on.</p>

<h1 id="cli">The <code>webgen</code> command</h1>

<p>The executable for webgen is called… webgen ;-) It uses a command style syntax (like Subversion’s
<code>svn</code> or Rubygem’s <code>gem</code> commands) through the <a href="http://cmdparse.rubyforge.org">cmdparse</a> library. To get an overview of the
possible commands run <code>webgen help</code>.</p>

<p>The main command is the <code>render</code> command which does the actual website generation. This command uses
either the environment variable <code>WEBGEN_WEBSITE</code> (if it is set and non-empty) or the current working
directory as website directory if none was specified via the gloabl <code>-d</code> option. All other commands
that need a valid webgen website directory specified work in the same way.</p>

<p>You can invoke a command by specifying its name after the executable name. Also counting the
executable <code>webgen</code> as a command, the options for a command are specified directly after the command
name and before the next command or any arguments. For example, all the following command lines are
valid:</p>

<pre><code>$ webgen
$ webgen render
$ webgen -d doc render
$ webgen -v create -t project new_site
$ webgen help create
</code></pre>

<p>Following is a short overview of the available commands:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code>apply [-f] (BUNDLE_NAME|BUNDLE_URL)</code></p>

    <p>The argument may either be a valid bundle name or an URL (in this case you will need to have all
dependencies for <a href="source/tararchive.html">Source::TarArchive</a> installed) to a bundle archive (a
(gzipped) tar archive). The command applies the bundle to the given webgen website. The files
that will be written to website directory are shown and the user is asked to confirm that the
shown files should indeed be written (and sometimes overwritten). If the <code>-f</code> option is used,
the files are always written.</p>

    <p>You can get the full list of available bundle names by running <code>webgen help apply</code>!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>create [-b BUNDLE] SITE_DIR</code></p>

    <p>Creates a basic webgen website in <code>SITE_DIR</code> using the optionally specified bundles. The option
<code>-b</code> can be used more than once to specify more than one bundle - the bundles are applied in the
order they are specified. As with the <code>apply</code> command, <code>BUNDLE</code> may either be a valid bundle
name or a bundle URL.</p>

    <blockquote class="information">
      <p>If you don’t specify the <code>-b</code> option, the default value is used which applies the <code>default</code>
and the <code>style-andreas07</code> bundles. The former only creates a simple <code>src/index.page</code> sothat
some output can be seen and the latter applies a nice layout.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>All available bundles are listed in the help output for the command.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>help</code></p>

    <p>Displays usage information. Can be used to show information about a command by using the command
name as argument, eg. <code>webgen help create</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>render</code></p>

    <p>Renders the given webgen website.</p>

    <blockquote class="information">
      <p>If you run webgen in verbose mode using the global <code>-v</code> option, it prints out information
about the written files. Note, however, that the shown paths are the <strong>internally used</strong> path
names which may be different from the actual output path names! For more information on this
have a look at the <a href="#source-cn">canonical path name</a> section!</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>version</code></p>

    <p>Displays the version of webgen.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>webgui</code></p>

    <p>Starts the webgen webgui, a browser based graphical user interface for managing webgen
websites. First the webgui web application is started and then the webgui is opened in the
default browser.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="website">A webgen Website</h1>

<p>webgen needs a special directory structure so that it works out of the box. This directory structure
is automatically created by the <code>webgen create</code> command. You can alternatively use the webgui to
create the website directory.</p>

<p>The root directory of webgen website is called the website directory. You can have the following
files and directories under this directory:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code>src</code>: The source directory in which all the source files for the website are. If this directory
should not be called <code>src</code> or you want to include additional source directories, you need to
change the <a href="reference_configuration.html#sources"><code>sources</code> configuration option</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>out</code>: This directory is created, if it does not exist, when webgen generates the HTML files. All
the output files are put into this directory. The name of this directory can be changed by setting
the <a href="reference_configuration.html#output"><code>output</code> configuration option</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>ext</code>: The extension directory (optional). You can put self-written extensions into this directory
so that they are used by webgen. See the <a href="#website-ext">extension directory</a> section for more
information.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>config.yaml</code>: This file can be used to set configuration options for the website. See the
<a href="#website-configfile">Configuration File</a> section for more information.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>Rakefile</code>: This file is provided for your convenience to execute tasks via <code>rake</code> and provides
some useful tasks out of the box. See the <a href="#website-rakefile">Rakefile</a> section for more
information.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="website-ext">Extension Directory</h2>

<p>The extension directory is used for modifying core behaviour of webgen or adding extensions. It is
called <code>ext</code> and has to reside directly under the website directory. All files called <code>init.rb</code> in
this directory or any of its subdirectories are loaded when webgen renders the website. So you need
to make sure to either place all extensions in <code>init.rb</code> or load them from this file. The latter
approach is better since you can use the lazy loading feature that webgen uses internally,
ie. extensions are loaded only when they are needed.</p>

<h2 id="website-configfile">Configuration File</h2>

<p>Many user will want to change some configuration options, for example, the default language of the
website since not all people will want to write websites in English. This is primarily done via the
configuration file.</p>

<p>The configuration file is called <code>config.yaml</code> and has to be placed directly under the website
directory. It uses <a href="http://www.yaml.org">YAML</a> as file format. You can find a list of all available
configuration options that can be set in the <a href="reference_configuration.html">Configuration Options
Reference</a>.</p>

<p>Each configuration option can be set in the configuration file by specifing the configuration option
name and the new value as a key/value pair. A sample configuration file looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>website.lang: de
website.link_to_current_page: true
</code></pre>

<p>Since some configuration options have a complex structure, there exist several special configuration
keys to help setting these configuration options:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code>default_meta_info</code>: Set the default meta information for one or more source handlers.</p>

    <p>This key needs needs a Hash as value which should be of the following form:</p>

    <pre><code>SOURCE_HANDLER_NAME:
  mi_key: mi_value
  other_key: other_value
  :action: replace
</code></pre>

    <p>So each entry has to specify the name of a source handler (or the special value <code>:all</code> which
sets the default meta information for all source handlers) and the meta information items that
should be set or modified. If you don’t want to update the meta information hash but want to
replace it, you need to add <code>:action: replace</code> as meta information entry.</p>

    <p>If a source handler called <code>Webgen::SourceHandler::SOURCE_HANDLER_NAME</code> exists, the meta
information is set for this source handler instead.</p>

    <p>For example, the following snippet of a configuration file sets the meta information item
<code>in_menu</code> to <code>true</code> for <code>Webgen::SourceHandler::Page</code>:</p>

    <pre><code>default_meta_info:
  Page:
    in_menu: true
</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>default_processing_pipeline</code>: Set the default processing pipeline for one or more source
handlers.</p>

    <p>This key needs a Hash as value which should be of the following form:</p>

    <pre><code>SOURCE_HANDLER_NAME: PIPELINE
</code></pre>

    <p>Each key-value pair specifies the name of a source handler and the new default processing
pipeline. The value for the processing pipeline has to consist of the short names of content
processors separated by commas and normally includes <code>erb</code>, <code>tags</code>, <code>blocks</code> and the name of a
content processor for a markup language. The short name(s) of a content processor is (are)
stated on its documentation page. Be aware that the content processors are executed in the order
in which they are specified!</p>

    <p>If a source handler called <code>Webgen::SourceHandler::SOURCE_HANDLER_NAME</code> exists, the meta
information is set for this source handler instead.</p>

    <p>For example, the following snippet of a configuration file sets the default processing pipeline
for ‘Webgen::SourceHandler::Page’:</p>

    <pre><code>default_processing_pipeline:
  Page: erb,tags,textile,blocks
</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>patterns</code>: Set the used path patterns for one or more source handlers.</p>

    <p>This key needs a Hash value and provides two different ways of setting the path patterns:</p>

    <pre><code>SOURCE_HANDLER_NAME: [**/*.jpg, **/*.css]

SOURCE_HANDLER_NAME:
  add: [**/*.jpg]
  del: [**/*.js]
</code></pre>

    <p>The first form replaces the path patterns for the source handler with the given patterns. The
second form allows to add or delete individual patterns.</p>

    <p>If a source handler called <code>Webgen::SourceHandler::SOURCE_HANDLER_NAME</code> exists, the meta
information is set for this source handler instead.</p>

    <p>For example, the following snippet of a configuration file adds the pattern <code>**/*.pdf</code> to the
patterns of <code>Webgen::SourceHandler::Copy</code>:</p>

    <pre><code>patterns:
  Copy:
    add: [**/*.pdf]
</code></pre>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="website-rakefile">Rakefile</h2>

<p>The Rakefile that is automatically created upon website creation provides a place to specify
recurring task for your website, for example, for deploying the website to a server. It contains
some useful tasks out of the box:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>webgen</code>: Renders the webgen website once.</li>
  <li><code>auto_webgen</code>: Automatically renders the website when a source file has changed. This is very
useful when developing a website because you don’t need to change back and forth between your
website code and the command line to rebuild the site.</li>
  <li><code>clobber_webgen</code>: Removes all webgen generated products (the output files and the cache file).</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="source">All About Paths and Sources</h1>

<p>A source provides paths that identity files or directories. webgen can use paths from many sources.
The most commonly used source is the file system source which provides paths and information on them
from the file system.</p>

<h2 id="source-types">Path Types</h2>

<p>webgen can handle many different types of files through the different source handler classes.</p>

<p>The most important files are the page and template files as they are used to define the content and
the layout of a website. Have a look at the <a href="webgen_page_format.html">Webgen Page Format
documentation</a> to see how these files look like and how they are
structured. After that have a look at the documentation of the source handler class
SourceHandler::Page and SourceHandler::Template as they are responsible for handling these page and
template files!</p>

<p>You can naturally use any other type of file. However, be aware that some files may not be processed
by webgen when no source handler class for them exists. For example, there is currently no source
handler class for <code>.svg</code> files, so those files would be ignored. If you just want to have files
copied from a source to the output directory (like images or CSS files), the
<a href="sourcehandler/copy.html">SourceHandler::Copy</a> class is what you need! Look through the
documentation of the <a href="extensions.html">availabe source handler classes</a> to get a feeling of what
files are handled by webgen.</p>

<h2 id="source-naming">Source Paths Naming Convention</h2>

<p>webgen assumes that the paths provided by the sources follow a special naming convention sothat meta
information can be extracted correctly from the path names. There are three different cases
depending on the type of path (the individual parts of a path are explained below):</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The path specifies a directory. It must end with a slash character and must not contain any hash
characters. A directory path has to follow the scheme:</p>

    <pre><code>/parent_path/basename/
</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The path specifies a file. It must not end with a slash character and must not contain any hash
characters. A file path has to follow the scheme:</p>

    <pre><code>/parent_path/[sort_info.]basename[.lang][.extension]
</code></pre>

    <p>There is one special case: if the file path has only one dot and only numbers are before the
dot, then the first part is considered to be the basename and the second part the extension (eg.
<code>53.png</code>)!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The path specifies a fragment (e.g. part of a file). It must contain exactly one hash character
and it has to follow the scheme (where <code>/parent_path</code> needs to be a file path):</p>

    <pre><code>/parent_path#basename
</code></pre>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Following is the explanation of the parts of the path names:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code>/parent_path</code></p>

    <p>This part specifies the path of the parent of this path and is used internally to create a
hierarchy of paths. Although the leading slash is explicitly written here, it is part of the
parent path, i.e. each parent path begins with a slash. Also note that the parent path will end
with a slash if it is a directory!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>sort_info</code></p>

    <p>This part is optional and has to consist of the digits 0 to 9. Its value is used for the meta
information <code>sort_info</code>. If not specified, it defaults to the value zero.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>basename</code></p>

    <p>This part is used on the one hand to generate the <code>title</code> meta information (but with <code>_</code> and <code>-</code>
replaced by spaces). And on the other hand, the <a href="#source-cn">canonical name</a> is derived from
it. <code>basename</code> must not contain any dots, spaces or any character from the following list: <code>; ?
* : ` &amp; = + $ ,</code>. If you do use one of them, webgen may not work correctly!</p>

    <blockquote class="important">
      <p>If two file paths have the same <code>basename</code> and <code>extension</code> part, they should define the same
content but for different languages. This allows webgen to automatically deliver the right
language version of the content.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>lang</code></p>

    <p>This part is optional and has to be an <a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/">ISO-639-1/2</a>
language identifier (two or three characters (a-z) long). It can only be specified if an
extension is also specified. If the file path should not have an extension, then just add a
trailing dot, e.g. <code>/dir/file.de.</code> - the trailing dot is ignored by webgen.</p>

    <p>If the language part is not specified, it is assumed that the path is language independent (for
example, images are normally not specific for a specific language). However, this behaviour may
be different for some source handler classes (for example, all paths handled by
SourceHandler::Page are assigned the default language if none is set).</p>

    <p>If the language identifier can’t be matched to a valid language, it is assumed that this part
isn’t actually a language identifier but a part of the extension. This also means that in the
special case where the first part of an extension is also a valid language identifier, the first
part is interpreted as language identifier and not as part of the extension!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>extension</code></p>

    <p>The file extension can be anything and can include dots.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Following are some examples of source path names (the acn and alcn parts are explained
<a href="#source-cn">below</a>):</p>

<p>Notice: The first two file path and the last two file path examples define the same content for two
different languages (or more exactly: the first one is unlocalized in both cases and the second one
localized to German) as they have the same canonical name.</p>

<h2 id="source-cn">Canonical Name (CN) of a File</h2>

<p>webgen provides the functionality to define the same content in more than one language, ie. to
localize content. This is achieved with the <em>canonical name</em> of a path, short CN.</p>

<p>The canonical name as well as all the other variants ([absolute] [localized] canonical name, all
described below) are created directly from the source paths sothat one can easily derive the
canonical name onself. Here are some examples:</p>

<table id="cn-example-table" style="border: 1px solid black; width: 100%">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Source path</th>
      <th>CN</th>
      <th>ACN</th>
      <th>LCN</th>
      <th>ALCN</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>/images/test/</code></td>
      <td><code>test/</code></td>
      <td><code>/images/test/</code></td>
      <td><code>test/</code></td>
      <td><code>/images/test/</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>/images/logo.png</code></td>
      <td><code>logo.png</code></td>
      <td><code>/images/logo.png</code></td>
      <td><code>logo.png</code></td>
      <td><code>/images/logo.png</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>/images/logo.de.png</code></td>
      <td><code>logo.png</code></td>
      <td><code>/images/logo.png</code></td>
      <td><code>logo.de.png</code></td>
      <td><code>/images/logo.de.png</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>/test.de.html#frag</code></td>
      <td><code>#frag</code></td>
      <td><code>/test.html#frag</code></td>
      <td><code>#frag</code></td>
      <td><code>/test.de.html#frag</code></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>What one can immediately see is that if a source path is unlocalized, the CN is the same as the LCN
and the ACN is the same as the ALCN. This is always true for directory and fragment paths since they
are always unlocalized! The first example shows a directory path - note the trailing slash! And the
last example shows a fragment path - note the difference in the ACN and the ALCN! Another
good-to-know fact is that an LCN is unique within its hierarchy level and that an ALCN is globally
unique!</p>

<blockquote class="information">
  <p>Source handlers can change some parts of a source path. For example, the page source handler
changes the extension from <code>page</code> to <code>html</code>. This has to be taken into account when specifying
canonical names! These changes are documented on the documentation pages for the source handlers!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When multiple paths share the same canonical name, webgen assumes that they have the same content
but in different languages. It is also possible to specify a <em>language independent</em> path (i.e. one
without a language) which is used as a fallback. Therefore when a path should be resolved using a
canonical name and a given language, it is first tried to get the path in the requested language. If
this is not possible (ie. no such localization exists), the unlocalized path is returned if it
exists.</p>

<p>For example, assume that we have the following <code>src</code> directory:</p>

<pre><code>/test.jpg
/images/my.jpg
/images/my.de.jpg
/index.page
/index.fr.page
/index.de.page
</code></pre>

<p>Since the path <code>images/my.jpg</code> has no language part, it is assumed to be unlocalized. In contrast,
<code>images/my.de.jpg</code> has the “same” picture but in a German version. So, when specifying
<code>images/my.jpg</code> in <code>index.de.page</code>, the correct localized version will be returned, i.e.
<code>images/my.de.jpg</code>. When specifying <code>images/my.jpg</code> in <code>index.page</code> or in <code>index.fr.page</code>, the
unlocalized version will be returned since no localized version exists.</p>

<blockquote class="important">
  <p>Directories and fragments are never localized, only files are!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is also possible to use the <em>localized canonical name</em> of a path (short: LCN) to resolve it. The
localized canonical name is the same as the canonical name but with a language code inserted before
the extension. If the localized canonical name is used to resolve a path, a possibly additionally
specified language is ignored as it is assumed that the user really only wants the path in the
specified language!</p>

<p>Continuing the above example, this means that <code>images/my.de.jpg</code> is always returned when one
specifies <code>images/my.de.jpg</code> in any of the index page files, e.g. even in <code>index.fr.page</code>.</p>

<p>Both canonical and localized canonical names can be absolute (ACN and ALCN) which is done by using
the full path starting with a slash. This is especially useful when you don’t exactly know in which
hierarchy level a certain canoncial name gets evaluated.</p>

<p>Everything said above also means that all paths are not resolved using their real source or output
names but using the (localized) canonical name! So when specifying paths for extensions, for example
when using the <a href="tag/relocatable.html">relocatable tag</a>, you always have to use the (absolute)
(localized) canonical names. This is different from previous webgen versions! However, it allows for
using a naming scheme based on the source paths to be used independently from the output paths and
therefore the output paths may change but no changes in the files themselves are needed.</p>

<h2 id="source-output">Output Path Name Construction</h2>

<p>There is currently only one method, called <code>standard</code>, for creating output path names which is
described here. However, webgen allows developers to create other output path name creation methods.
More information on this can be found in the <a href="rdoc/index.html">API documentation</a>.</p>

<p>The output path for a given source path is constructed using the meta information
<code>output_path_style</code>. This meta information is set to a default value and can be overwritten by
setting it for a specific source handler or for a path individually. The value for this meta
information key is an array which can have the following values:</p>

<ul>
  <li>strings (for inserting arbitrary text into output names)</li>
  <li>arrays (for grouping values - only interesting for the language part)</li>
  <li>symbols for inserting special values:
    <ul>
      <li><code>:basename</code>: The basename of the path.</li>
      <li><code>:parent</code>: The parent path.</li>
      <li><code>:lang</code>: The language.</li>
      <li><code>:ext</code>: The file extension including the leading dot.</li>
      <li><code>:year</code>, <code>:month</code>, <code>:day</code>: The creation year, month and day, respectively, of the source path.
An error is raised if the needed meta information <code>created_at</code> is not set on the path.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote class="important">
  <p>The constructed output path must always be an absolute one, ie. it has to start at the root of the
output directory. Therefore, the <code>:parent</code> part should always be included!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Following are some examples of output path names for given source path names (assuming that <code>en</code> is
the default language and that the path is under a directory called <code>/img/</code>):</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code>output_path_style=[:parent, :basename, [., :lang], :ext]</code> (the default)</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><code>index.jpg</code> –&gt; <code>/img/index.jpg</code></p>

        <p>Since the source path is unlocalized, no language part is used and the whole sub array with
the <code>:lang</code> symbol is dropped.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code>index.en.jpg</code> –&gt; <code>/img/index.jpg</code></p>

        <p>This happens if the configuration option <code>sourcehandler.default_lang_in_output_path</code> is
<code>false</code> and no unlocalized version of this path exists.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code>index.en.jpg</code> –&gt; <code>/img/index.en.jpg</code></p>

        <p>Similar to the last example but this result occurs when there is an unlocalized version of
the path which is naturally named <code>index.jpg</code>!</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code>index.de.jpg</code> –&gt; <code>/img/index.de.jpg</code></p>

        <p>Since <code>de</code> is not the default language, the language part is always used!</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>output_path_style=[:parent, :basename, :ext, ., :lang]</code></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><code>index.jpg</code> –&gt; <code>/img/index.jpg.</code></p>

        <p>Be aware of the trailing dot since the <code>:lang</code> value is not defined in a sub array!</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>output_path_style=[:parent, :year, /, :month, /, :basename, [., :lang], :ext]</code></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><code>index.jpg</code> –&gt; <code>/img/2008/09/index.jpg</code></p>

        <p>This output path style can be used to create blog archive style output names.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="source-pathpattern">Path Patterns</h2>

<p>Each source handler specifies path patterns which are used to locate the files that the class can
handle. Normally these patterns are used to match file extensions, however, they are much more
powerful. For detailed information on the structure of path patterns have a look at the
<a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Dir.html#M002375">Dir.glob</a> API documentation.</p>

<p>The path patterns that are handled by a particular source handler are stated on its documentation
page. These patterns can be changed by modfying the configuration option <code>sourcehandler.patterns</code>
although that is not recommended except in some few cases (for example, it is useful to add some
patterns for SourceHandler::Copy). The information about how these path patterns work are useful for
the usage of webgen because of two reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>so that you know which files will be processed by a specific source handler class</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>so that you can specify additional path patterns for some source handlers like the
SourceHandler::Copy</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some example path patterns:</p>

<table class="examples">
<tr><th>Path Pattern</th><th>Result</th></tr>
<tr>
  <td>`*/*.html`</td>
  <td>All files with the extension `html` in the subdirectories of the source directory</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>`**/*.html`</td>
  <td>All files with the extension `html` in all directories</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>`**/{foo,bar}*`</td>
  <td>All files in all directories which start with `foo` or `bar`</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>`**/???`</td>
  <td>All files in all directories whose file name is exactly three characters long</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2 id="source-handling">Handling of files in the source directory</h2>

<p>Following is the list of rules how source files are handled by webgen:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>All path names of all sources specified in the configuration option
<a href="reference_configuration.html#sources"><code>sources</code></a> are fetched. Prior listed sources have priority
over later listed sources if both specify the same path.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those paths which match a pattern of the configuration option
<a href="reference_configuration.html#sourcehandlerignore"><code>sourcehandler.ignore</code></a> are excluded.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The source handler classes are invoked according to the invocation order specified in
<a href="reference_configuration.html#sourcehandlerinvoke"><code>sourcehandler.invoke</code></a> and they use only those
paths that match one of their path patterns specified in
<a href="reference_configuration.html#sourcehandlerpatterns"><code>sourcehandler.patterns</code></a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As you might have deduced from the processing list above, it is possible that one path is handled by
multiple source handlers. This can be used, for example, to render an XML file as HTML and copy it
verbatim.</p>

<h2 id="source-metainfo">Path Meta Information</h2>

<p>Each path can have meta information, i.e. information about the path itself, associated with it, for
example the title of the path, if it should appear in a menu and so on. This meta information can be
specified in several ways, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Source handlers can provide default meta information for their handled paths (set using the
configuration option
<a href="reference_configuration.html#sourcehandlerdefaultmetainfo"><code>sourcehandler.default_meta_info</code></a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some file types allow meta information to be specified directly in the file, for example page
files in <a href="webgen_page_format.html">Webgen Page Format</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Meta information can also be specified in special meta information backing files. These files are
handled by the source handler <a href="sourcehandler/metainfo.html">SourceHandler::Metainfo</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There is clearly defined order in which meta information is applied to a node for a path:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The path gets read by a source and some meta information is extracted from the path name.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This meta information is overwritten with meta information specified for all source handlers and
then with meta information specified for the source handler that handles the path.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Extensions can now overwrite meta information before the path gets handled by a source
handler. For example, the SourceHandler::Metainfo assigns meta information specified for paths at
this stage.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before the node for the path gets created, meta information from the content of the path itself
may overwrite the current meta information (this is the case, for example, with files in Webgen
Page Format).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The node gets created with the provided meta information.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After the node has been created, extensions may overwrite meta information again. For example,
the SourceHandler::Metainfo assigns meta information specified for nodes at this stage.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h1 id="webgen-extensions">webgen Extensions</h1>

<p>webgen comes with many extensions that allow for rapid creation of static websites. The variety of
the extensions allows you to use your tools of choice, for example, your preferred markup
language. And if your choice is not available, you can write the extension for it yourself or make a
feature request!</p>

<p>Extensions are only loaded when they are needed. For example, if you don’t use <code>.feed</code> files for
automatically generating atom/RSS feeds for your website, the source handler that handles these
files will never be loaded. Therefore you don’t need to explicitly enable extensions, they just sit
in the background and wait till the webgen core needs them.</p>

<p>There are several types of extensions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Content Processors</strong>: These extensions process content, for example, the content of files in
Webgen Page Format. It is not specified how they have to process the content but this type of
extension can basically be divided into two groups:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Text content processors: These processors are used to process textual content like files in
Webgen Page Format. This group can furthe be divided:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Markup processors: Processors like kramdown or RedCloth belong to this group and they
convert markup text that is easy to read and write to a more structure format like HTML.
This allows you to write an HTML page without knowing HTML.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>String replacers: These processors normally process special strings and substitute them
with other content. For example, the <code>erb</code> processors replaces delimited strings
interpreted as Ruby code with the interpreted value. Another example would be webgen’s
<code>tags</code> processor which replaces strings like <code>{relocatable: ../index.html}</code> with a
processed value.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Binary content processors: These processors are used to process binary data. For example, one
might want to process an image to produce a thumbnailed version of it.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Source Handler</strong>: These extensions are used for handling source paths. They read the content of
a path and produce one or more nodes (the internal representation of an output path, see <a href="#source-handling">source
handling</a> for more information on nodes). So a source handler can do something
simple like just copying a source path to the output directory but they can also do complex
things like creating a whole image gallery from just one source path.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Tags</strong>: This type of extension allows the easy inclusion of dynamic content in, for example,
page and template files. Each tag extension is used for a specific task like creating a menu or
a breadcrumb trail.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="a-webgen-run">A webgen Run</h1>

<p>When webgen is started, it first looks for a cache file and uses it if it exists. The cache file
provides information on the previous run and allows webgen to render only those paths that have
changed since the last time.</p>

<p>Each webgen run consists of one or more update/write cycles. During the update phase the internal
tree structure is updated to reflect the current situation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Nodes are created from newly found source paths.</li>
  <li>If a source path was deleted since the last webgen run, the nodes created from it will be deleted.</li>
  <li>All nodes in the tree are checked if they have changed and, if so, are marked for regeneration.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote class="information">
  <p>The name used for describing a directory or file once it is placed in the internal tree structure
is ‘node’.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After the update cycle has finished, the internal tree representation is up-to-date and contains all
necessary information to write its nodes. This is done in the write phase which writes out all
changed nodes.</p>

<p>It is possible that the internal tree structure changes during the write phase. For example, after
writing a page file fragments node for it may have been generated. After the write phase it is
checked if something like this has happened. If webgen finds such a condition, a new update/write
cycle is initiated. This is done as long as needed.</p>

<p>Since it is possible that multiple update/write cycles are used in one webgen run, it is shown in
the log messages when a new cycle started. This is necessary because sometimes some warning or error
log messages may be generated during an earlier cycle but the error conditions are automatically
solved in later cycles. By marking where the cycles start a user can compare the log messages of the
different cycles and see what he needs to solve himself.</p>

<h1 id="extending-webgen">Extending webgen</h1>

<p>If you know the programming language Ruby a little bit, you can easily extend webgen and add new
features that you need. All the needed developer documentation is available in the <a href="rdoc/index.html">API
documentation</a>, along with sample implementations for all major types of extensions
(source class, output classes, source handler class, content processors classes, tag classes, …)
and detailed information about the inner workings of webgen. Have a look at the <a href="#website-ext">extension
directory</a> section for more information on naming files and where to put the
extensions.</p>

<h1 id="create-website-style">Creating a Website Style Bundle</h1>

<p>webgen ships some style bundles sothat one can create a basic website out of the box. However, if
you want to create a website style bundle yourself, it is easy.</p>

<p>The following assumes that you already have a website template, i.e. an HTML file with your layout,
the accompanying CSS file and the needed images. The example below assume you have one downloaded
from <a href="http://www.openwebdesign.org/">http://www.openwebdesign.org/</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>First create the needed directories and the README file:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The bundle directory: <code>BUNDLE</code></li>
      <li>The source directory: <code>BUNDLE/src</code></li>
      <li>The README file: <code>BUNDLE/README</code></li>
    </ul>

    <p>The README file contains information about your style bundle in YAML format. You should include at
least the <code>description</code> and <code>author</code> keys:</p>

    <pre><code>description: Website template based on the OSWD template BUNDLE
author: Me Myself
</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unzip the the archive from OSWD and move the extracted files into the <code>BUNDLE/src</code> directory.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rename the file <code>BUNDLE/src/index.html</code> (or whatever the main HTML file is called) to
<code>default.template</code>. Now go through this file and augment relative URLs to style sheets, images and
other files with <a href="tag/relocatable.html">relocatable tags</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Identify the location of the main menu items, remove them and and use a <a href="tag/menu.html">menu tag</a>
instead. You may need to restrict the shown menu levels to a single level if the template is built
for only one main menu level. Then adjust the CSS used to style the menu to include the webgen
specific CSS classes for showing the currently selected link. Remember that you need to take care
of styling not only <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tags but also <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> tags. See the <a href="tag/menu.html">menu tag
documentation</a> for more information on how the menu is output by webgen and what
CSS classes can be used!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Adjust the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> tag in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section of the <code>default.template</code> file – you can use the
<code>{title:}</code> to insert the title of the processed page file.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Identify the location where the page content should go and put <code>&lt;webgen:block name=&quot;content' /&gt;</code>
there. This tells webgen to insert the block named <code>content</code> of the page file that uses the
template at this location.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the template features a breadcrumb trail area, use the <a href="tag/breadcrumbtrail.html">breadcrumb trail
tag</a> so that the breadcrumb trail gets created automatically.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The BUNDLE directory can now be directly used since it is a valid webgen website directory. If you
want to publish your style bundle, just create a (gzipped) tar archive from the contents of the
BUNDLE directory.</p>
